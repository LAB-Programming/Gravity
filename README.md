#Gravity
========
A cool gravity simulator which simulates (somewhat accurately)
gravitational forces in 2-Dimensions

##Known Bugs:
* Method of closing currently doesn't work needs to be force quit.
* I don't believe that G would be the same in 2D and 3D gravity
* Bouncing / fusing doesn't to use the right bounding box
* Bouncing off walls doesn't use the right bounding box

##Important Improvements:
* More Interactability!!!!
    * Add and delete bodies
    * Move Bodies

##Future Plans:
* Configure it so that you can actually make sun-planet systems
