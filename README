A cool gravity simulator which simulates (somewhat accurately)
gravitational forces in 2-Dimensions

Known Bugs:
	-Method of closing currently doesn't work needs to be force quit
	-We need to be clear on what units are being used
	-Simulation speed is very finicky with too fast and too slow not
		really working
Important Improvements:
	-More Interactability!!!!
		-Add and delete bodies
		-Move Bodies
	-Bodies Fuse or bounce
Future Plans:
	-Configure it so that you can actually make sun-planet systems
