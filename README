A cool gravity simulator which simulates (somewhat accurately)
gravitational forces in 2-Dimensions

Known Bugs:
	-Method of closing currently doesn't work needs to be force quit -- FIXED!
	-I don't believe that G would be the same in 2D and 3D gravity
	-Simulation speed is very finicky with too fast and too slow not
		really working -- FIXED
Important Improvements:
	-More Interactability!!!!
		-Add and delete bodies
		-Move Bodies
	-Bodies Fuse or bounce
Future Plans:
	-Configure it so that you can actually make sun-planet systems
